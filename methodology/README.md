## Methodology

This folder documents the core methodology used in the posture monitoring
system.

The system uses webcam-based video input and computer vision techniques to
detect human posture. Skeletal landmarks are extracted using pose estimation,
and joint angles are calculated to evaluate posture quality.

User-specific calibration is performed to define thresholds for posture
classification.
